# Implementation Plan — Sequenced Execution & Release Roadmap

**Date:** 2026-07-11 · **Last verified:** 2026-07-12
**Target releases:** `v0.2.0` (WS-A … WS-H) → `v0.3.0` (WS-I, WS-J) · **Current version:** `0.1.0` (`pyproject.toml`)

> **2026-07-12 expansion.** A fresh code-verification pass confirmed WS-B landed
> (S4–S13 fixed in source) and re-verified the forensic review's F1–F21 / U1–U11.
> This revision **carries those findings into the roadmap**: forensic soundness is
> added to `v0.2.0` as **WS-H**, and engine correctness/growth open a **`v0.3.0`**
> cycle as **WS-I** and **WS-J** (see [§3](#3-consolidated-backlog--single-index),
> [§4](#4-work-streams--the-ordered-how), [§7](#7-status-tracking)).

## 1. Purpose & How to Use This Document

The `docs/reviews/` audit produced three evidence trackers and one notes file. They
say *what* is wrong and *why* — but the open work is scattered across all of them
with no single ordering and no link to how DataForge actually ships. **This document
is the one sequenced execution + release plan.** It answers: *what do I do next, in
what order, which commits, and when do I cut the release?*

It does not replace the trackers — it **links into** them:

| Read this for… | Document |
| --- | --- |
| Bug/security detail, line-level evidence, fixes | [`AUDIT_FINDINGS.md`](./AUDIT_FINDINGS.md) |
| UX/engineering rationale, per-item backlog | [`IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md`](./IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md) |
| Doc-defect audit (D1–D7) | [`NOTES_REVIEW.md`](./NOTES_REVIEW.md) |
| Status overview, brand, Definition of Done | [`EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md`](./EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md) |
| Forensic-soundness, security, investigator-UX architectural findings (F1–F21, U1–U11) | [`FORENSIC_SECURITY_REVIEW.md`](./FORENSIC_SECURITY_REVIEW.md) |
| Commit format, branch model, versioning, release checklist | [`../CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md) §2, §3, §6, §7 |

### 1.1 Documentation standard — every item answers Where / Why / How

This is the required framing for every finding, work-stream, and task in *all*
review documents (see [`../CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md) §8):

- **Where** — the exact location: `path:line`, component, or doc section.
- **Why** — the impact if left unfixed: the risk, defect, or user cost that
  justifies the work. Never "because the review said so."
- **How** — the concrete approach: the fix, the seam it lands at, and the test
  that proves it.

Each work-stream in [§4](#4-work-streams--the-ordered-how) is written to this
standard. Per-item Where/Why/How lives in the linked trackers.

### 1.2 Provenance — these findings are code-verified, not assumed

The backlog below was **checked against the current source tree**, not copied on
trust from the review files. Verified open, with evidence:

| ID | Verified open at (2026-07-11, plan authoring) | Evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| S2 | `dataforge/modules/forensics.py:581-625` | interpolated values, no `html.escape()` | ✅ **Fixed** (WS-A) |
| S4 | `dataforge/modules/recovery.py:225-250` | `original_path` → `shutil.move` + `os.makedirs` | ✅ **Fixed** (WS-B) |
| S5 | `dataforge/ui/plugin_loader.py:38-51` | `exec_module()`, no signing/sandbox | ✅ **Fixed** (WS-B) |
| S7 | `dataforge/modules/system_cleanup.py:249` | blanket junk classification | ✅ **Fixed** (WS-B) |
| S8 | `dataforge/modules/password_tools.py:246` | `open(hash_file, "w")`, no `0o600` | ✅ **Fixed** (WS-B) |
| S9 | `dataforge/modules/forensics.py:1033` | `xml.etree.ElementTree`, no `defusedxml` | ✅ **Fixed** (WS-B) |
| S10 | `dataforge/core/config.py` | blind merge, zero validation | ✅ **Fixed** (WS-B) |

Also verified: NOTES_REVIEW **D1–D3 are already resolved in the source docs** — the
broken anchor, `"224"` count, and dead `docs/reviews/01` refs now survive *only
inside NOTES_REVIEW.md itself* as its audit record. `TECHNICAL_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md`'s
~16 unprefixed `core/`/`modules/` path references (D4/D5) are **fixed** (WS-A, 17
references corrected). Baseline: `PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q` → **255 passed**
(was 254 at plan authoring; +1 for the S2 regression test).

**2026-07-12 re-verification (forensic-soundness expansion).** A second code pass
confirmed every WS-B fix is present in the current source (S4 `_is_safe_restore_path`
at `recovery.py:205-227`; S5 owner/permission guards at `plugin_loader.py:40-75`;
S7 socket/age guards at `system_cleanup.py:267-286`; S9 `defusedxml` at
`forensics.py:1048`; S11 executable-open confirm at `widgets.py:860-866`) and
re-verified the forensic review's F1–F21 / U1–U11 against source (line drift and
now-stale UI wording corrected in [`FORENSIC_SECURITY_REVIEW.md`](./FORENSIC_SECURITY_REVIEW.md)).
The eight new modules those findings propose (`core/audit.py`, `core/case.py`,
`core/image_io.py`, `core/acquire.py`, `core/streams.py`, `core/dt.py`,
`core/parse_worker.py`, `modules/sanitisation.py`) correctly do **not** exist yet —
they are the WS-H/WS-I/WS-J deliverables below.

> **Rule of engagement:** every task below maps to a Conventional Commit
> (`type(scope): description`, see [CONTRIBUTING §3](../CONTRIBUTING.md)) with a stated
> version impact. All work lands on `develop`; a single `develop`→`main` PR cuts `v0.2.0`.

## 2. Release Strategy — the "When"

### 2.1 Model

`v0.2.0` (MINOR — the backlog contains `feat` work: task-oriented IA, Automations
merge, `fm devices` GUI) ships **eight sequenced work-streams (WS-A … WS-H)**, where
**WS-H** adds the forensic-soundness layer (chain-of-custody, Evidence Mode,
acquisition provenance). Each stream lands on `develop` and is closed by an **alpha
tag** when the suite is green. When *all* streams are merged and the release checklist
passes, **one** `develop`→`main` PR promotes the release through beta → rc → GA.

The engine-correctness and engine-growth findings that move DataForge from
"file manager" to "investigative tool" open a **`v0.3.0`** cycle as **WS-I** and
**WS-J** — they depend on the WS-F service seams and WS-H forensic layer, so they
cannot land before `v0.2.0` closes.

```
main     ●────────────────────────────────────●── v0.2.0-beta.1 ─●── rc.1 ─●── v0.2.0 ─── … ──●── v0.3.0
          \                                   /                                                /
develop    ●──●──●──●──●──●──●──●──●──●──●──●──●   (alpha.1 … alpha.8)      ●──●──●──●  (v0.3.0 alphas)
           A  A  B  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  ↑                                 I  I  J  J
                                         v0.2.0 release PR opens here
```

### 2.2 When to commit to `develop` — commit-as-you-complete

- **Commit the moment a logical task is complete.** Do not batch several tasks into
  one commit, and never leave a finished task uncommitted. One Conventional Commit
  per logical change, on a `feat/…` | `fix/…` | `chore/…` | `refactor/…` branch off
  `develop` (see [CONTRIBUTING §2–3](../CONTRIBUTING.md)). This is a standing rule,
  not a per-release one — it also governs the documentation work in this plan.
- Merge the branch back into `develop` when **its own tests are green**.
- **Tag `v0.2.0-alpha.N` on `develop` at the close of each work-stream**, once
  `PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q` passes for the whole suite. That tag is the "this stream
  is done / cut an alpha" signal. Alpha tags are allowed on `develop` only
  (see [CONTRIBUTING §2](../CONTRIBUTING.md) branch table).

```bash
# commit a completed task, then close the stream on develop
git commit -m "fix(modules): html-escape interpolated values in forensic report"
# … remaining stream tasks, each its own commit …
git checkout develop
PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q            # whole suite must pass
git tag v0.2.0-alpha.N
git push origin develop --tags
```

### 2.3 When to open the release PR — `develop` → `main`

Open the `develop`→`main` PR **only when every `v0.2.0` work-stream (A–H) is merged** and the
[CONTRIBUTING §7](../CONTRIBUTING.md) pre-merge checklist passes:

**Definition of releasable (mirrors CONTRIBUTING §7):**

- [ ] `PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q` — all tests pass
- [ ] `pyproject.toml` `[project] version` bumped to `0.2.0`
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` — `[Unreleased]` entries moved under a `[0.2.0]` heading
- [ ] `docs/` cross-references verified (no broken links)
- [ ] `python setup.py sdist` succeeds
- [ ] `python build_exe.py release` succeeds
- [ ] Smoke test: `fm dupes --help`, `fm search --help`, `fm devices --help`, GUI launches
- [ ] **No HIGH-severity open security findings** → **S2 must be fixed** (it is, in WS-A)

The PR then walks the stable-channel tags on `main`
(`v0.2.0-beta.1` → soak → `v0.2.0-rc.1` → `v0.2.0` GA). Full commands in
[§5 Release Runbook](#5-release-execution-runbook).

## 4. Work-Streams — the Ordered "How"

Streams run **in order** (stabilize-first). Each closes with an alpha tag on
`develop` once `PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q` is green. Every stream is stated as
**Where / Why / How** ([§1.1](#11-documentation-standard--every-item-answers-where--why--how)).

### WS-A — Stabilize & Doc Truth → `v0.2.0-alpha.1` ✅ CLOSED

- **Where:** `.github/workflows/`, `pyproject.toml`, `.githooks/`,
  `dataforge/modules/forensics.py:581-625`, `docs/TECHNICAL_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md`,
  `docs/reviews/NOTES_REVIEW.md`. Items P0.1–P0.7, S2, D4/D5, NOTES_REVIEW 3.1–3.3.
- **Why:** there is no automated green-gate, so regressions can land silently; S2 is
  a HIGH finding that makes court-grade forensic output unsafe and **blocks the
  release**; and the docs still misstate paths, eroding trust in the source map.
- **How:** add a GitHub Actions workflow running `pytest`+`ruff`+`mypy`+coverage on
  push/PR to `develop`+`main`; add ruff/black/mypy config, pre-commit hooks, and
  migrate packaging to `pyproject.toml` with `pip-audit`/Dependabot; `html.escape()`
  every interpolated value in the forensic report + a `<script>`-filename regression
  test; run the `dataforge/` path audit over TSOT and retire the A5 staleness caveat.

**Representative commits:**
```
chore(repo): add GitHub Actions CI (pytest + ruff + mypy + coverage)
chore(build): add ruff + black config and mypy settings
chore(repo): add pre-commit hook config
chore(build): migrate setup.py metadata to pyproject.toml
chore(build): pin security libs and enable pip-audit / Dependabot
fix(modules): html-escape interpolated values in forensic report
test(modules): guard forensic report against script-tag filename
docs: prefix core and modules paths with dataforge in source-of-truth
docs: add last-verified datestamps and retire staleness caveat
```
**Version impact:** PATCH (from S2). **Gate:** CI must be green before WS-B opens — ✅ satisfied (255 passed, ruff clean, pip-audit clean; `v0.2.0-alpha.1` tagged locally on `develop`).

### WS-B — Trust & Safety (remaining security) → `v0.2.0-alpha.2` ✅ CLOSED

- **Where:** `dataforge/modules/recovery.py:225-250` (S4),
  `system_cleanup.py:249` (S7), `dataforge/ui/plugin_loader.py:38-51` (S5),
  `forensics.py` (S6/S9/S12/S13), `password_tools.py:246` (S8),
  `dataforge/core/config.py` (S10). Items S4–S13.
- **Why:** these are live abuse paths — arbitrary file write from a crafted
  `.trashinfo`, blanket deletion of `/tmp` and cache trees, in-process execution of
  unsigned plugins, false destruction guarantees, world-readable secrets, XML
  entity-expansion DoS, and unvalidated config merge. Each can cause data loss,
  code execution, or disclosure on untrusted input.
- **How:** work AUDIT_FINDINGS "Recommended remediation order" — S4→S7→S5→S6→S8→
  S9→S10→S11→S12→S13 — one `fix(...)` per finding, each paired with the regression
  test named in [§3 Testing gaps]. Forensic-soundness (UTC timestamps, provenance)
  noted here; the audit-log + root-confinement seam-controls land in WS-F on
  already-hardened code.

**Representative commits:**
```
fix(modules): confine trash-restore paths and block traversal
test(modules): guard trash-restore against crafted trashinfo paths
fix(modules): allow-list cleanup targets and skip sockets and fifos
fix(ui): gate plugin loading behind opt-in flag with load logging
fix(modules): make secure_delete best-effort and drop trash fallback
fix(modules): write credential and hash files with 0600 permissions
fix(modules): parse xml with defusedxml to block entity expansion
fix(core): validate config types ranges and enums on load
fix(ui): confirm before opening executables via the OS handler
fix(modules): write forensic report artefacts with 0600 permissions
fix(modules): cap image pixels and pdf pages against decompression bombs
```
**Version impact:** PATCH (cumulative). **Gate:** ✅ satisfied (260 passed, ruff
clean, pip-audit clean; ready for the `v0.2.0-alpha.2` tag on `develop`).

### WS-C — Interaction Correctness (Phase 2c) → `v0.2.0-alpha.3`

- **Where:** `dataforge/ui/views/base.py` (2c.1/2c.5/2c.7),
  `views/settings.py:199-273` (2c.2), `app.py` dark-mode + tier + busy-bar
  (2c.3/2c.4/2c.6). Items 2c.1–2c.7.
- **Why:** these are the highest-friction trust defects — a Yes/No/Cancel riddle for
  file-vs-folder, settings that silently do or don't persist, features hidden behind
  experience tiers, and a truncated destructive preview the user can't review row by
  row. They directly undermine confidence in destructive operations.
- **How:** replace the message-box riddle with `choose_file`/`choose_directory`
  entry points; autosave settings with a transient "Saved ✓"; make one dark-mode
  control writable and mirror it; show all sidebar groups and gate complexity behind
  "More options"; render destructive preview as a scrollable checkable table; name
  the running task in the busy bar; render help as markdown. Add a settings
  round-trip test.

**Representative commits:**
```
fix(ui): replace file-or-folder message box with explicit pickers
fix(ui): autosave settings with a transient saved indicator
fix(ui): mirror dark mode from sidebar in settings as a label
fix(ui): show all sidebar groups regardless of experience tier
feat(ui): per-row opt-out destructive preview with running total
fix(ui): name the running task in the status bar
feat(ui): render view help as markdown with inline whats-this helper
test(ui): round-trip settings persistence
```
**Version impact:** MINOR (2c.4/2c.5/2c.7 are `feat`). **Gate:** ✅ satisfied
(270 passed — 260 → 270 over seven incremental commits; ruff clean; the
`choose_file_or_directory` riddle is gone and the sidebar no longer filters
groups by tier; ready for the `v0.2.0-alpha.3` tag on `develop`).

### WS-D — IA, Naming & Parity (Phase 2d) → `v0.2.0-alpha.4`

- **Where:** `dataforge/ui/app.py:322-328` (sidebar groups), view labels across
  `dataforge/ui/views/`, new "Storage & Devices" view over `fm devices`. Items 2d.1–2d.5.
- **Why:** navigation is organised around developer module boundaries, not user
  tasks — duplicate-sounding destinations, split Hardware/Performance, and `fm devices`
  with no GUI path. This is the parity/coherence gap and the reason the release is a
  MINOR.
- **How:** regroup the sidebar into Home / Find & Organize / Clean & Optimize /
  Recover & Investigate / System; merge Tools + Action Builder into "Automations"
  with sub-tabs; apply the label renames from IMPROVEMENT_PLAN §2.3; add the Storage
  & Devices view; sweep residual "File Manager"/"filemanager-utils" names. Add a
  pytest-qt smoke test mounting every view.

**Representative commits:**
```
refactor(ui): regroup sidebar into task-oriented sections
feat(ui): merge tools and action builder into automations
refactor(ui): rename module labels to task-oriented names
feat(ui): add storage and devices view surfacing fm devices
refactor: sweep residual file-manager naming across the app
test(ui): smoke-mount every view with pytest-qt
```
**Version impact:** MINOR. **Gate:** ✅ satisfied (276 passed — 270 → 276 over
six incremental commits: 2 sidebar regroup, 2 Automations, 2 label renames, 1
Storage & Devices, 1 name sweep, 1 smoke test. The new sidebar groups and
view titles are stable; the new Storage & Devices and Automations views
mount cleanly; the smoke test confirms every registered view is
instantiable. Ready for the `v0.2.0-alpha.4` tag on `develop`).

### WS-E — Motion, Empty/Error, A11y (Phase 2e) → `v0.2.0-alpha.5`

- **Where:** `dataforge/ui/app.py:220-234` (Braille spinner), `theme_tokens.py`
  (focus-ring), views (empty/error states, accessible names), new
  `dataforge/ui/resources/icons/`. Items 2e.1–2e.7.
- **Why:** the spinner is a character hack, there is no focus-ring rule after
  `outline:0` was removed, empty/error states are generic, group identity is
  colour-only, and there is no reduce-motion or screen-reader support — accessibility
  and polish gaps that exclude keyboard and assistive-tech users.
- **How:** animate sidebar collapse + view crossfade; replace the spinner with an
  indeterminate `QProgressBar`; add a reduce-motion flag; add a focus-ring token and
  `:focus` rules; give each view a purposeful empty state and friendly errors; add
  accessible names and a non-colour channel (icons + spacing); ship a monochrome
  sidebar icon set.

**Representative commits:**
```
feat(ui): animate sidebar collapse and view-switch crossfade
fix(ui): replace braille spinner with indeterminate progress bar
feat(ui): add reduce-motion preference
feat(design): add focus-ring token and focus outline rules
feat(ui): add per-view empty states and friendly error messages
feat(ui): add accessible names and colour-blind icon channel
feat(design): add monochrome sidebar icon set
```
**Version impact:** MINOR.

### WS-F — Architecture Consolidation → `v0.2.0-alpha.6`

- **Where:** `modules/search.py` + `core/actions/filters.py` (ARCH.1),
  `modules/cleaner.py` + `modules/metadata.py` (ARCH.2), `core/provider.py` (ARCH.3),
  `core/services/` `FileActionService` (ARCH.4/ARCH.5), carving in `modules/forensics.py`
  (ARCH.6). Items ARCH.1–ARCH.6.
- **Why:** two filter engines and two metadata cleaners are duplicate sources of
  truth that create long-term correctness risk; `LocalProvider` is dead
  infrastructure; and the service seam is the right single place to enforce
  root-confinement and a tamper-evident audit log. Landing these after security means
  the new controls sit on hardened code.
- **How:** route Action Builder filters through `SearchQuery`; pick the exiftool
  engine as the one metadata cleaner; adopt-or-delete `LocalProvider`; add a
  root-confinement guard and an append-only audit-log hook in `FileActionService`;
  stream carving instead of buffering to RAM. Keep the existing suites green through
  each refactor.

**Representative commits:**
```
refactor(actions): route action-builder filters through search-query
refactor(modules): make exiftool the single metadata cleaner
refactor(core): remove dead local-provider seam
feat(core): enforce root confinement in file-action service
feat(core): append every mutation to a tamper-evident audit log
refactor(modules): stream carving instead of buffering to memory
```
**Version impact:** MINOR (ARCH.4/ARCH.5 are `feat`).

### WS-G — Brand & Release Polish → `v0.2.0-alpha.7`

- **Where:** GitHub repo settings, `pyproject.toml` `[project] description`, GUI
  About dialog, `EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md` Definition of Done. Items BR.1–BR.4.
- **Why:** the brand tasks and DoD are the last open items on the healthy-project
  checklist; leaving them undone means the release ships with mismatched metadata and
  an unfinished DoD.
- **How:** update the GitHub description/topics (repo setting, not a commit); add
  a `description` field to `pyproject.toml`'s `[project]` table with the tagline;
  show "DataForge" + tagline in About; tick off the Definition of Done. Then open
  the release PR.

**Representative commits:**
```
chore(build): add DataForge tagline to pyproject.toml project description
feat(ui): show DataForge name and tagline in the about dialog
docs: tick off definition of done and open brand tasks
```
BR.1 (GitHub description/topics) is a repo-settings action, not a commit.
**Version impact:** MINOR (BR.3).

### WS-H — Forensic Soundness → `v0.2.0-alpha.8`

- **Where:** new `dataforge/core/audit.py`, `core/case.py`, `core/dt.py`,
  `modules/sanitisation.py`; the `FileActionService` seam (ARCH.4/ARCH.5 from WS-F);
  `modules/forensics.py` report writer (F2); `modules/duplicates.py` (F21). Items
  **F1, F2, F3, F4, F9, F11, F21, U1, U2** — per-item detail in
  [`FORENSIC_SECURITY_REVIEW.md`](./FORENSIC_SECURITY_REVIEW.md) §2/§4.
- **Why:** these are the *disqualifying* gaps for any forensic-product claim — no
  chain-of-custody, no acquisition provenance, no read-only Evidence Mode, mixed-tz
  timestamps, and a `secure_delete` sitting inside the forensic module. ACPO
  Principle 1–2, ISO/IEC 27037 §6.4, RFC 3227, and NIST SP 800-86 all require them;
  without them contested results are excludable and procurement marks "fail."
- **How:** build the append-only HMAC-chained audit log (F1/F11) on the ARCH.5 hook;
  add `CaseContext` (U1) and the Evidence-Mode write-gate on the ARCH.4
  root-confinement seam (F3/U2, with a sticky status-bar badge); standardise every
  timestamp to UTC ISO-8601 via `core/dt.py` (F9); extend the report dict with
  operator/host/source-image hash (F2); relocate `secure_delete` to
  `modules/sanitisation.py` and make it hardlink/reflink-aware (F4/F21). One
  `feat`/`fix`/`refactor` commit per finding, each with its named test from the
  review.

**Representative commits:**
```
feat(core): add append-only hmac-chained audit log
feat(core): add case context and evidence-mode write gate
fix(modules): emit utc iso-8601 timestamps across forensic outputs
feat(modules): record acquisition provenance in forensic reports
refactor(modules): move secure_delete to sanitisation module
fix(modules): make secure_delete and dedup hardlink-aware
feat(ui): add case/evidence/operator context and evidence-mode badge
```
**Version impact:** MINOR (F1/F2/F3/F11/U1/U2 are `feat`). **Gate:** closes
`v0.2.0-alpha.8`; **the `v0.2.0` release PR opens after this stream** (see §2.3, §5).

---

## 4b. `v0.3.0` Work-Streams — Manager → Investigative Tool

These open after `v0.2.0` ships; they depend on the WS-F seams and the WS-H
forensic layer. Same commit/alpha-tag discipline as §4.

### WS-I — Engine Correctness → `v0.3.0-alpha.1`

- **Where:** `modules/recovery.py` carver (F6), new `core/streams.py` (F8),
  `core/scanner.py` + `duplicates.py`/`search.py` (F10, F16), new
  `core/parse_worker.py` (F13), `core/common.py` `FileEntry` + forensics ingest
  (F14), `keyword_search` (F15), `_run_cmd` (F17), `system_cleanup.py` residual
  (F18), trash-restore audit (F19), locked-file detection (F20a), UI (U5, U6, U7,
  U8), Windows Recycle Bin (U11).
- **Why:** make the engine *correct* before adding new surface — alignment-free
  carving, ADS enumeration (omitting it makes the tool dangerous on Windows
  evidence), Unicode/homograph safety, in-process parser isolation, sparse- and
  locked-file handling, and the highest-signal investigator-fatigue UI wins.
- **How:** stream the carver on ARCH.6 with an Aho-Corasick multi-pattern match and
  a cheap validation pass; add cross-platform stream/xattr enumeration; normalise
  NFC/NFD and flag bidi/confusables; run untrusted parsers in an rlimited
  `ProcessPoolExecutor`; stream ingest with MACB fields and fix the `created_at`
  mislabel; budget keyword-search memory; surface sparse/locked flags in reports;
  ship the mismatch filter, glyph pairing, preview source-correlation, drag-drop
  lockdown, and the `$I`/`$R` Recycle Bin parser.

**Representative commits:**
```
refactor(modules): stream the carver with alignment-free matching
feat(core): enumerate alternate data streams and xattrs
fix(core): normalise filenames and flag bidi/homograph names
feat(core): isolate untrusted parsers in an rlimited worker pool
fix(core): detect sparse files and surface locked-file access errors
feat(ui): add suspicious-mismatch filter and glyph-paired status
```
**Version impact:** MINOR. **Gate:** closes `v0.3.0-alpha.1`.

### WS-J — Engine Growth → `v0.3.0-alpha.2`

- **Where:** new `core/image_io.py` (F5), new `modules/indicators.py` + cache schema
  (F7), new `core/acquire.py` (F20b), new `ui/views/timeline.py` (U3), new
  `ui/widgets/hexview.py` (U4), timeline keybindings (U9), OS-artifact parity (U10).
- **Why:** the features that move DataForge from "file manager" to "investigative
  tool" — read E01/AFF4 without mounting, YARA/TLsh/NSRL triage, Volume Shadow Copy
  acquisition of locked volumes, a virtualised timeline, a hex field inspector,
  keyboard-first navigation, and Windows/macOS artifact parity.
- **How:** dispatch on magic bytes for image formats with a read-only assertion;
  bundle `yara-python` + TLsh with a `tlsh` cache column and an NSRL hashset table;
  add the VSS/raw-volume acquisition path (completes F20); build the virtualised
  `QTreeView` timeline and the `HexView` field inspector; add vim-style keybindings;
  add `python-registry`/prefetch parsers or scope the README to Linux.

**Representative commits:**
```
feat(core): read e01/aff4/dd images without mounting
feat(modules): add yara, tlsh, and nsrl known-good pivots
feat(core): acquire locked volumes via volume shadow copy
feat(ui): add virtualised timeline and hex field inspector
```
**Version impact:** MINOR. **Gate:** closes `v0.3.0-alpha.2`; then the
`v0.3.0` release PR.

## 5. Release Execution Runbook

Once all eight `v0.2.0` alpha streams (A–H) are merged and the §2.3 checklist passes
(commands from [CONTRIBUTING §6–7](../CONTRIBUTING.md)); the same runbook cuts
`v0.3.0` after WS-I and WS-J:

```bash
# 1. Prep on develop
git checkout develop
PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q
# bump pyproject.toml [project] version to 0.2.0
# move CHANGELOG [Unreleased] entries under a new [0.2.0] - 2026-XX-XX heading
git add pyproject.toml CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "chore(release): bump to 0.2.0"

# 2. Release PR develop -> main, then beta/rc/GA on main
git checkout main
git merge develop --no-ff
git tag v0.2.0-beta.1
git push origin main --tags
# soak / smoke test; fix-forward on develop and re-merge if needed
git tag v0.2.0-rc.1 && git push origin main --tags
git tag v0.2.0     && git push origin main --tags   # GA

# 3. Back-merge and open next cycle
git checkout develop && git merge main && git push origin develop
# bump pyproject.toml to 0.2.1.dev
```

Pre-tag gate for every stable tag: `python setup.py sdist` and
`python build_exe.py release` succeed; `fm dupes/search/devices --help` and the GUI
launch; no HIGH-severity open security finding.

---

## 6. Verification & Test Mapping

**Green-gate (every stream):** no `alpha.N` tag is cut until `PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q`
passes for the whole suite ([CONTRIBUTING §5](../CONTRIBUTING.md)).

| WS | Regression / smoke tests |
| --- | --- |
| A | Forensic report escapes `<script>` filename (S2); CI runs the full suite on push |
| B | `.trashinfo` traversal confined (S4); cleanup spares user folders (S7); config clamps bad keys (S10) |
| C | Settings persistence round-trip (2c.2) |
| D | pytest-qt mounts every view incl. Storage & Devices (2d.4); `fm devices --help` smoke |
| E | pytest-qt mounts views with animations/empty states; reduce-motion honored |
| F | Existing filter/metadata/service suites stay green after consolidation; audit-log append verified |
| G | GUI About renders tagline; `python setup.py sdist` + `build_exe` succeed |
| H | Audit-log tamper refuses start (F1); report carries provenance keys (F2); evidence mode blocks every mutator (F3/U2); every timestamp ends `+00:00` (F9); hardlink `secure_delete` refuses (F21) |
| I | Carver finds mid-sector JPEG + rejects PNG bomb (F6); ADS enumerated (F8); NFD==NFC grouping + bidi flagged (F10); parser worker killed by rlimit (F13); sparse + locked-file flags recorded (F16/F20a); mismatch filter surfaces `evil.jpg` (U5) |
| J | E01/dd `FileLike` SHA-256 matches raw (F5); YARA/TLsh/NSRL hits (F7); VSS reads a locked fixture (F20b); 100k-event timeline scroll keeps RSS flat (U3); PNG IHDR decoded in hex inspector (U4) |

**Release verification:** the §2.3 "Definition of releasable" checklist gates the
`develop`→`main` PR; the §5 pre-tag gate gates each stable tag.
